Design and implement a simple Laravel application that fulfills the following
requirements:

● Create a user authentication system with registration, login, and logout
functionality.
● Users should be able to create, read, update, and delete their own posts.
● Implement a background task using Laravel's task scheduling to send a
daily email digest of the top posts to all users.
● Ensure that sensitive user data, such as passwords, are securely stored
using Laravel's encryption features.
